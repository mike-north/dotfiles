# Mike's Dotfiles

These are my own dotfiles, which contain configuration for

- zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
- git
    - Multi-identity environment, with independent SSH keys and `.gitconfig` for employee & OSS work
    - vscode as a `difftool` and `mergetool`
    - `nano` as a `core.editor`
    - dozens of other small settings for improved UX
- macos settings and preferences
- `nano` with syntax highlighting, linting and formatting
- `editorconfig`
- a `Brewfile` that installs a bunch of packages I regularly need
