# Breaking down big changes into incremental PRs

When this set of rules is mentioned, it's because I'd like to break this down into a sequence of stacked PRs (https://trailhead.corp.stripe.com/docs/stack), each of which
- builds successfully
- has no lint warnings or errors linting
- has meaningful tests
- has an up-to-date API report (look for the npm script to run api-extractor)
- has up-to-date generated docs (look for the npm script to run api-documenter)
- each PR should be in a branch, with the next PR in the stack using the HEAD of the previous PR as the base commit

The hope is to keep each PR under 1000 lines, not accounting for generated content like lockfiles, the API report (possibly in a `./api-report` subfolder) and docs (possibly in a `./docs` subfolder).

## Recommended things to add as you go
It's ok (and encouraged) to
- Write tests can go beyond what's implemented right now
- Improve code commenting
- Fix bugs as you find them

## Do not break PRs up by stricly choosing entire files (in their current state) to introduce in layers
- Each PR should leave the project in an understandable state. This will _almost always_ involve making changes to files incrementally.
- Arrange PRs in terms of introducing _capabilities_, and then layer new capabilities on top in successive PRs
- Tests for the new capabilities should always be introduced in the same PR
